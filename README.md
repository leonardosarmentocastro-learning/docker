### Commands

- [docker create](#docker-create)
- [docker start](#docker-start)
- [docker run](#docker-run)
- [docker system prune](#docker-system-prune)

#### docker create

Creates a containers, which means, takes a "file system snapshot" of a desired Docker image and allocates it to a namescape inside our hard-drive.

```sh
docker create hello-world # "hello-world" is the Docker image name
c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # The ID of the container is printed.
```

It is important to notice that "startup command" can only be overriden during this step and can't be done in the future when running the same container.

#### docker start

Runs the "startup command" of a given container previously generated by a Docker image.

```sh
docker start c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # This serial number refers to the previously created container ID.
c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # The container ID is printe as well.
```

The container ID is printed instead of the long text message we were used to see. Why?

The `docker start` command, by default, doesn't stick to the container initialization, which means that all signals of "STDOUT/STDERR" from the container are not being listed, therefore, will never be displayed.

To actually see the output we were used to, we need to provide the `--attach, -a` flag.

```sh
docker start -a c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916
Hello from Docker! # The message is correctly printed.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

#### docker run

Stands for the combination between `docker create` + `docker start`.

```sh
docker run <image-name>
docker run <image-name> <command> # The "command" argument overrides the "run command" specified by the given docker image

# e.g.
docker run ubuntu -it bash
docker run ubuntu echo hello, I\'m overriding the startup command for this container
```

#### docker system prune

Removes all stopped containers, images and build cache (images downloaded from Docker Hub).

```sh
docker ps -a
