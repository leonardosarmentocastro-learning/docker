#### `docker create`

Creates a containers, which means, takes a "file system snapshot" of a desired Docker image and allocates it to a namescape inside our hard-drive.

```sh
$ docker create hello-world # "hello-world" is the Docker image name
c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # The ID of the container is printed.
```

It is important to notice that "startup command" can only be overriden during this step and can't be done in the future when running the same container.

#### `docker start`

Runs the "startup command" of a given container previously generated by a Docker image.

```sh
$ docker start c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # This serial number refers to the previously created container ID.
c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916 # The container ID is printe as well.
```

The container ID is printed instead of the long text message we were used to see. Why?

The `docker start` command, by default, doesn't stick to the container initialization, which means that all signals of "STDOUT/STDERR" from the container are not being listed, therefore, will never be displayed.

To actually see the output we were used to, we need to provide the `--attach, -a` flag.

```sh
$ docker start -a c041449b290027271787eb3a97f817c2a5af6c2d3efa91c4764775f3e8fec916
Hello from Docker! # The message is correctly printed.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

#### `docker run`

Stands for the combination between `docker create` + `docker start`.

```sh
$ docker run <image-name>
$ docker run <image-name> <command> # The "command" argument overrides the "run command" specified by the given docker image

# e.g.
$ docker run ubuntu -it bash
$ docker run ubuntu echo hello, I\'m overriding the startup command for this container
```

You can even start your container and use its shell.

```sh
$ docker run -it busybox sh # could be "zsh", "bash" ...
# ls
# pwd
# ...
```

#### `docker system prune`

Removes all stopped containers, images and build cache (images downloaded from Docker Hub).

```sh
$ docker ps -a

$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

#### `docker logs`

Can be used to retrieve results from all "STDOUT/STDERR" emited so far by the container.

```sh
$ docker create busybox echo initializing the container
d9b9cc803a92476d1dbcb8fe2ead52eb541730dce9c6293cef87b015747b91c5

$ docker start d9b9cc803a92476d1dbcb8fe2ead52eb541730dce9c6293cef87b015747b91c5
d9b9cc803a92476d1dbcb8fe2ead52eb541730dce9c6293cef87b015747b91c5

$ docker logs d9b9cc803a92476d1dbcb8fe2ead52eb541730dce9c6293cef87b015747b91c5
initializing the container
```

Note: this command does not start the container, it only reads its "STDOUT/STDERR" stream output.

#### `docker stop`

Emits a `SIGTERM` (terminate signal) to the container and give it 10 seconds until it can gracefully shutdown.

If it doesn't respond/end the process in 10 seconds, it will fallback to `docker kill` command, killing it right away.

```sh
$ docker create busybox ping google.com

#### `docker kill`

Emits a `SIGKILL` (kill signal) to the container, killing it right way, giving it no time for a graceful shutdown.

```sh

```

#### `docker exec`

Executes a given command inside the container and then exit it.

If you want to _interact_ with the container's bash, you must use the `-it` flag.

```sh
$ docker run redis

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
dfb7e776b3c5        redis               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        6379/tcp            loving_hamilton

$ docker exec -it dfb7e776b3c5 redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> # Execute your redis command here.
```

Not providing the `-it` would execute the command and kick you off from the container's bash instantaneously.

```sh
$ docker run redis

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
dfb7e776b3c5        redis               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        6379/tcp            loving_hamilton

$ docker exec -it dfb7e776b3c5 redis-cli
$ # Your terminal is waiting for new commands.
```

The flag `-it` is actually a combination of two flags, the `-i` and `-t`.

The `-i` flag attaches your bash to the `STDIN` (standard stream input) of the container, which means that everything that you type will be sent to `redis-cli` as an input (as if you were typing).

The `-t` flag attaches your bash to the `STOUT` (standard stream output) of the container, which means that everything responded by the `redis-cli` will be displayed and formatted for you in your bash.

If you want to avoid executing this command everytime you need to execute a bash command, you use `sh` (or `bash`, `zsh`...) as the `docker exec` command.

```sh
$ docker exec -it dfb7e776b3c5 sh
# ls
# cd
# ...
```
